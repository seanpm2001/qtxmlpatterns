    /**
     * @short Picks out a slice from another QAbstractXmlForwardIterator, specified by a start and end position.
     *
     * SubsequenceIterator allows a "slice", a subsequence, from an QAbstractXmlForwardIterator to
     * be extracted. The SubsequenceIterator's constructor takes a source QAbstractXmlForwardIterator,
     * a start position, and the length of the subsequence to be extracted.
     *
     * SubsequenceIterator contains the central business logic to implement
     * the <tt>fn:subsequence()</tt> function. The detailed behavior, such as how it behaves
     * if the source QAbstractXmlForwardIterator is empty or if the specified subsequence stretches
     * beyond the source QAbstractXmlForwardIterator, is therefore consistent with the definition of
     * the <tt>fn:subsequence()</tt> function.
